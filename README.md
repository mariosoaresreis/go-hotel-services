- Domain Driven Design and Hexagonal architecture
- Unit tests covering most of the code and alternative paths
- The rules used are commented in the source code
- It was used ID's instead of names as input in the request
- Blankets was NOT found as JobItem
- Due to available time, it was not used Rules Engine
- (linux) To start the application type ./start.sh in the root directory
- if I had more time, I would implement cache and graphQL features
